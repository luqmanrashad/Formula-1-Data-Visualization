This project was made to represent Formula 1 racing data across the years in an appealing and informative online visualization.

Key Features:
- Scatterplot comparing driver standings and average qualifying lap time. Hover over the node to get specific details on each driver. Drivers on the same team are represented using the same color scheme
- Zoom in and out by scrolling over a node on the scatterplot
- Click and drag on a node to emphasize certain drivers
- Annual points earned is represented by size
- Progress through the years by utilizing the buttons next to the scatterplot
- Toggle Dark Mode by pressing the toggle button
- An additional graph on the side represents driver progress in comparison with other drivers across years active. Drivers to be represented are selected by clicking on the node of any driver. Clicking on the node again will remove the driver from the graph. Inactive drivers have 0 points associated for years inactive. 


This project was completed December 2022 in a group repository, but I moved it here to have a bit more control over the program and keep the github webpage active
